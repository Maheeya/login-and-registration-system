# login-and-registration-system
This is a simple registration and login system. The programme will ask is the user would like to register as a new user or login to an already existing account. If the user would like to register it will take in details and store it in a file. If user would like to login would enter details and would read file to check the credentials.

This is a beginner project I have chosen to do to get comfortable with c++.
